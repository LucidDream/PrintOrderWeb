# Estimator Configuration (for demos/testing)
# =============================================================================
# These values control how toner usage is estimated for print jobs.
# Increase these values to consume more ink during demonstrations.
#
# Formula: toner_ml = sheets × (coverage/100) × base_ml × quality_modifier

# Base toner consumption: mL per sheet at 100% page coverage
# Default: 0.15 (industry standard)
# Demo suggestion: 0.50 - 1.0 for higher consumption
ESTIMATOR_BASE_TONER_ML=0.15

# Page coverage percentage (how much of the page is covered in ink)
# Default: 10 (10% - industry standard for text documents)
# Demo suggestion: 30 - 50 for higher consumption
ESTIMATOR_PAGE_COVERAGE_PERCENT=10

# =============================================================================
# Demo Mode Examples:
# =============================================================================
# For a demo that uses ~3x more ink than default:
#   ESTIMATOR_BASE_TONER_ML=0.50
#   ESTIMATOR_PAGE_COVERAGE_PERCENT=30
#
# For a demo that uses ~10x more ink than default:
#   ESTIMATOR_BASE_TONER_ML=0.50
#   ESTIMATOR_PAGE_COVERAGE_PERCENT=100
